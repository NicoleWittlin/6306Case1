## Introduction

Introduction to the project. The introduction should not reference a project, persay. No
part of this should be informal.

The introduction needs to be written as if you are presenting the work to someone who
has given you the data to analyze and wants to understand the result. Pretend its a
presentation for a client. This may take some imagination of whom your client might be.
If it sounds like a student presentation, that is not acceptable.
